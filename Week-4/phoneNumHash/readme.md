## Mini Algo Hash Phone Number

### Objectives

- Storing plain text phone numbers is never a good idea! Your algorithm should hash a phone number and only display the last 4 numbers. Everything else should become a `*`, the hyphens must remain in their respective places.
- Feel free to use any methods you find useful!

## Getting Started

- Fork and Clone
- `npm i`
- `npm run test` or `npm test` and make sure the tests fail.


The objective of this problem is to assess your knowlegde of loops and formatting strings.
