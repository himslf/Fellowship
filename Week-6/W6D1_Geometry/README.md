# Objects-Day-3

# Object-Oriented JavaScript Practice

## Geometry

For this exercise, you'll be building a few classes using object-oriented programming practices. You'll be using [ES6 Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

We'll be building three geometric objects:

1. Rectangle
2. Triangle
3. Line Segment
 
## Documentation

Please see the [documentation](./doc.md) for more details about how to construct the classes. 

## Getting started

1.  Install dependencies and begin testing with `npm it`.
